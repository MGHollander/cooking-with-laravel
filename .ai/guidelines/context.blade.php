# Application Context

Cooking with Laravel is a personal recipe management web application built with Laravel and Vue.js. It solves the common problem of losing track of favorite recipes scattered across different websites, apps, and sources. The application allows users to create, edit, and organize their recipes in one centralized location, complete with features like recipe import from web pages using AI-powered tools, search functionality, and simple user management. It's designed to be a practical solution for home cooks who want to keep their favorite recipes organized and easily accessible.

## Development Guidelines

- When implementing any new functionality that would affect the project's installation process, update the readme to reflect the new steps
- Never include comments in the code unless absolutely necessary. If you feel like you need to add a comment, consider if the code can be refactored to be more readable instead
- Mimic the code style of the existing project, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns
- Focus on creating code that provides an excellent developer experience (DX), good autocompletion, type safety, and comprehensive docblocks
