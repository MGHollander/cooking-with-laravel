        <p>
            a programmer from the Netherlands.

        <p>
            This project was born from the frustration that my girlfriend and I have trouble finding
            recipes that we have taken from the internet. When we want to make the dish again, we
            spend more time searching for the recipe than cooking itself. We have to go through all app groups. Look in
            our search history. You know the drill.
        </p>

        <p>
            With this web application, all our favorite recipes are in one place. No more searching!<br>
            <small style="color: var(--color-gray)">(Unless we forget to add a new gem...)</small>
        </p>

        <p>
            The code for this web application is open source and can be found on
            <a href="https://github.com/MGHollander/cooking-with-laravel/" target="_blank">my GitHub</a>. With a
            little knowledge of setting up web applications, you can put together your own recipe collection.<br>
            Unfortunately, I can\'t help you with the setup, but it\'s on my wishlist to eventually make a service out of
            this web application, so that everyone can use it.
